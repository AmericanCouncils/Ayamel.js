Setup
==========
1. Create a Canvas element and get the 2d context
	<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
	var context = document.getElementById("canvas").getContext("2d");

2. Create a timeline	
	timeline = new Timeline();
    timeline.init(context, length);
    
3. Create the subtitles and add them to the timeline
	/* The parameters are
	 *  - Start time in milliseconds
	 *  - End time in milliseconds
	 *  - The text of the subtitle
	 *  - The index */
	var segs = [
		new Segment(0, 2000, "This is the first subtitle", 0),
		new Segment(3000, 4000, "This is the second", 1),
		new Segment(5000, 6000, "This is the third", 2),
		new Segment(7000, 8000, "This is the fourth", 3)
	];
	/* The parameters are
	 *  - An array of Segment objects
	 *  - An external Id (not necessary--it's just somewhere to put one)
	 *  - Language
	 *  - Read only */
    timeline.addSegmentTrack(segs, "track-external-id", "en", false);

4. Define the external functions that you want to use. If you are not going to be using them, then ignore them.
	// getTextCallback is called whenever a subtitle is selected. The text of the subtitle is given as the first argument
    timeline.getTextCallback = function(text) {};
	// unselectCallback is called whenever a subtitle is deselected
	timeline.unselectCallback = function() {};
	// jump is called whenever the time is changed (either the user clicked in the time bar or the time marker extended beyond the bounds of the AB repeat area.
	timeline.jump = function(time) {}
	// abRepeatEnabled is called whenever the AB repeat functionality is turned on
	timeline.abRepeatEnabled = function() {}
	// update is called whenever the contents of the timeline change
	timeline.update = function() {}

5. Draw the timeline
    timeline.render();
    timeline.update();

Note: Whenever you want to update the time in the timeline call
	timeline.updateTimeMarker(time);
